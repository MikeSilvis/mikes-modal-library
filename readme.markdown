## Usage

1) Download the javascript, styles and include them.
```html
<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="https://raw.github.com/MikeSilvis/mikes-modal-library/master/lib/mikes-modal.css">
<script src="http://raw.github.com/MikeSilvis/mikes-modal-library/master/lib/mikes-modal.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

2) Create a div on your page with the class .mikes-modal
```html
<div class="mikes-modal" id="myModal">
  <img src='http://s3.amazonaws.com/ultimate_whip/garage_photos/photos/000/000/079/large/38779594009_original.jpeg?1349826286'>
  <div class="description">
    <h1>Title of Modal</h1>
    <p>Put whatever content you need here. I personally used it for comments and tags :)</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
3) Add a button, link, image or whatever you need to open the modal.
```html
<a id="open-mikes-modal" class="btn btn-primary btn-large">Try it now!</a>
```
4) Add a jQuery call back when you click the button
```javascript
jQuery(function() {
  $("#open-mikes-modal").click(function(e) {
      $("#myModal").mikesModal();
  });
});
```
## Helpers

```javascript

  $("#myModal").trigger("close");
  $("#myModal").bind("open", function() {
    myCustomFunction();
  });
